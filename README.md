# Time-Travelling File System

A simple, in-memory version control system for files, written in C++. You can create files, make changes, view history, branch, and roll back to earlier versionsâ€”all from the command line.

---

### Build & Run on Linux/Mac

```bash
chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh
./program
```
---

Type EXIT to quit the program (or, like, control + C)

## What Can You Do?

- **CREATE \<filename>**: Make a new file (starts at version 0)
- **READ \<filename>**: Show the current content
- **INSERT \<filename> \<content>**: Add content (creates a new version)
- **UPDATE \<filename> \<content>**: Replace content (creates a new version)
- **SNAPSHOT \<filename> \<message>**: Mark the current version with a message
- **ROLLBACK \<filename> [versionID]**: Go back to a previous version (by ID or just the previous one)
- **HISTORY \<filename>**: See all versions and their messages
- **RECENT_FILES [num]**: List the most recently changed files
- **BIGGEST_TREES [num]**: List files with the most versions
